   - `quit` - Exit the game

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ejmabunda/UnoCLI.git
   cd UnoCLI

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Start the game and select number of players
2. Choose player names and AI difficulty levels
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to play cards
4. Use special commands:
   - `help` - Show available commands
   - `hand` - View your current hand
   - `quit` - Exit the game

### Game Rules

Standard Uno rules apply:

- Match cards by color or number
- Special action cards: Skip, Reverse, Draw Two
- Wild cards: Wild, Wild Draw Four
- Call "Uno" when you have one card left
- First player to empty their hand wins

#### Card Play Logic

Each card type implements a `play(GameState state)` method that defines its effect when played. This method is called by the player logic and updates the game state accordingly. See `src/main/java/tech/mabunda/card/README.md` for details.
